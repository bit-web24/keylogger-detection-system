Keylogger Detection System

Focus: Build a program to detect unusual keyboard/mouse behavior and prevent it.

A keylogger is a type of malware that secretly records everything a person type (passwords, messages, etc.).
A Keylogger Detection System is a program that watches the keyboard and mouse activity to detect unusual or suspicious behavior, indicating that a keylogger might be running.


Basic Workflow

1. Monitor Input Events

2. The program keeps track of keyboard and mouse activity.

Example: How often keys are pressed, typing speed, or mouse movement patterns.

3. Detect Suspicious Activity

4. Compare the activity with normal user behavior.

Examples of suspicious patterns:

	* Typing happens when the user is idle
	* Sudden rapid keystrokes
	* Hidden processes reading keystrokes

5. Check Running Processes

Look for processes/programs that access keyboard input or clipboard secretly.
Some keyloggers run in the background without showing a window.


6. Alert the User

If unusual behavior is detected, the system raises an alert:
	* Pop-up message
	* Log entry

7. terminate suspicious process

8. Block the suspicious process or restrict access to input devices.

9. Log all detected events for further analysis.

Decoy Input Injection: Create a system that periodically injects fake keystrokes at the driver level and monitors if they get captured or logged anywhere they shouldn't be.
